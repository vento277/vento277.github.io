            <h1>Peter Kim</h1>
            <p>
                I'm an electrical engineering student at the University of British Columbia.
                Currently, I write firmware at UBC Sailbot and build products at UBC Smart City.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm free, I watch movies, take long walks, and study investments.
            </p>
