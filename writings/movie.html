            <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;text-align: center;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" id="docs-internal-guid-7bed69ab-7fff-b5d5-96e1-eb8cc20424f9"><span style="font-size:20pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">CAN YOU WATCH A MOVIE?</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">There was a time when a movie was an event. You’d get your ticket, find your seat, and let the world fade away. Two hours, sometimes three. The dark and the quiet held you. You’d stay, because you wanted to see the whole story. But that was then.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Now, watching a movie is harder. Attention, which used to be solid, is now brittle. Our brains have changed, rewired to crave quick hits. A flicker of a reel, a swipe of a TikTok. A second or two, then on to the next. It’s fast, exciting. You watch for a moment, then forget. And this is how things go now. This is what kids know.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">They’re drawn to screens, to things that don’t require memory, just reaction. Watching a movie takes more. You have to follow a plot, keep details in mind. But TikTok clips? Each second is its own thing. No background, no thread to follow. And you can see it changing how we read, too. Reading a book needs time; thoughts move in order, one part leading to the next. Now reading feels slow, almost like work. For most people, a book is tough going. The mind wanders.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Education is suffering the same fate. Real learning isn’t a burst of insight—it’s something you build over time. It unfolds, like a story, with each part resting on the part before. But when our minds are tuned to flashes of novelty, that kind of learning feels slow, even irritating. The structure, the careful pace that understanding needs, just can’t compete with the thrill of something new. It’s not just that students struggle to learn; they don’t even want to. Why sit with something that takes work when you can swipe to the next thing?</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">You see it in classrooms now, too. Restlessness. Lessons that are meant to build knowledge feel like hurdles to jump over. Minds drift to phones, looking for an escape from the slow, layered process of learning. Ideas slip away, concepts go unexplored. Real understanding needs a kind of patience, a commitment that’s getting rare. Just like movies and books, learning is something fewer people really stay with.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">So, we go to theaters, but we bring this impatience with us. Eyes dart around, looking for something to pull us in right away. Even if the movie is good—the acting, the story, everything done well—if it drags, even a little, you feel it. You feel the itch to check your phone, to scroll through something new. A movie asks for all of you. TikTok asks for a second, then hands you the rest back. The theater, once a haven, feels foreign now.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">And theaters are paying for it. Seats aren’t as full, screens flicker a bit more, phones glow through the dark. Each year, fewer people go. They can’t sit still for that long. They don’t want to. It’s easier to watch at home, where you can pause, stop, or switch to something else whenever you want.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Losing attention has effects beyond movies. Weak attention weakens memory. The mind skims, never fully absorbing. With that, we lose the ability to think deeply, to connect ideas, to remember things that matter. It’s like missing the plot—not only in stories, but in life. Facts get slippery; meaning is harder to hold onto.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Education is feeling this shift, too. A fractured attention makes it hard to understand things in depth or to build on ideas. Learning becomes surface-level, more about skimming than grasping. Instead of grappling with ideas, we sample them and move on. Watching a movie once meant being fully present. So did learning. Now both are at risk. Students might make it through school, but the learning they walk away with is thin. We settle for fragments instead of whole ideas.</span></p><br><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.2;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">When patience fades, we stop looking for depth. Instead, we grab for quick, easy pleasures. Easy to watch, easy to forget. Meaning takes work; pleasure doesn’t. So, can you watch a movie? Can you read a book? Can you really learn something? For many, the answer is no. Sitting still, following a thread, holding the quiet needed for depth—it’s harder than ever. And so, we live in a world of snippets, things we can take in quickly, forget just as fast, and move on.</span></p><br><br>
