    <h1>Mengzi and Xunzi</h1>
    <p>2024 July</p>
    <br>
    <p>A harmonious society is created when it truly understands human nature and aligns its</p>
    <p>governance with this understanding. Mengzi and Xunzi, two leading philosophers of ancient</p>
    <p>China, had distinct interpretations of Confucian ethics and social order. Their perspectives on</p>
    <p>achieving a harmonious society were influenced by the changing conditions of their times,</p>
    <p>leading them to advocate differing conclusions about human nature.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Confucius, born in 551 BCE during the late Spring and Autumn period in the state of Lu,</p>
    <p>focused primarily on the concept of ren, often translated as ‘benevolence.’ His philosophy</p>
    <p>emphasized the importance of internal virtues as the foundation of social order. For Confucius,</p>
    <p>ren was an intrinsic quality that one should cultivate within oneself. In his time, when social</p>
    <p>order was relatively stable, he believed that the cultivation of ren alone could sustain societal</p>
    <p>harmony.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mengzi, born in 372 BCE in the state of Zou, faced a more complex societal context during the</p>
    <p>Warring States period. The increasing fragmentation and conflicts of his era required more than</p>
    <p>the internal virtues espoused by Confucius. Mengzi extended Confucian thoughts with yi, or</p>
    <p>‘righteousness,’ as a moral principle that, if violated, would lead to moral condemnation and a</p>
    <p>sense of shame.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mengzi argued that people are born with a natural inclination toward goodness and that every</p>
    <p>person possesses an innate moral potential, or a ‘seed’ of virtue, which can be cultivated into full</p>
    <p>moral excellence. In his work, the Mencius, he uses the metaphor of water to illustrate his view:</p>
    <p>“Human nature being good is like water tending downward. There is no human who does not</p>
    <p>tend toward goodness. There is no water that does not tend downward” (Mengzi, Book 6A: 2.2).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mengzi also highlighted the role of education in nurturing these inherent virtues. He used an</p>
    <p>agricultural metaphor to illustrate this: “Consider barley. Sow the seeds and cover them… Hence,</p>
    <p>in general, things of the same kind are all similar” (Mengzi, Book 6A: 7.2). For Mengzi, human</p>
    <p>goodness is to be cultivated by providing the right environment, including proper teachings.</p>
    <p>When this innate goodness is well-cultivated and combined with the pursuit of righteousness, it</p>
    <p>results in a harmonious society.</p>
    <br>
    <p>On the other hand, Xunzi, born in 310 BCE, lived during the later stages of the Warring States</p>
    <p>period, a time marked by intense conflict among the seven major states vying for dominance.</p>
    <p>This era demanded more rigorous mechanisms for social control than mere moral persuasion.</p>
    <p>Xunzi emphasized the need for laws and formal regulations, expanding the concept of li in a</p>
    <p>more legalistic context.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Xunzi believed that human nature is inherently flawed and driven by selfish desires: “People’s</p>
    <p>nature is bad. Their goodness is a matter of deliberate effort” (Readings in Classical Chinese</p>
    <p>Philosophy, Chapter 23: paragraph 1). He argued that, without strict rules and education, people</p>
    <p>would naturally lean toward conflict and self-interest. To counter these tendencies, Xunzi</p>
    <p>proposed that human nature must be shaped and refined through ritual, education, and discipline:</p>
    <p>“Thus, crooked wood must await steaming and straightening on the shaping frame, and only then</p>
    <p>does it become straight” (Readings in Classical Chinese Philosophy, Chapter 23: paragraph 2). In</p>
    <p>Xunzi’s view, a well-ordered society could only be achieved through external cultivation of</p>
    <p>virtue and adherence to social norms.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Confucius’ moral framework occupies a nuanced position between Mengzi’s view of inherent</p>
    <p>human goodness and Xunzi’s assertion of innate evil. While not explicitly stating that human</p>
    <p>nature is inherently good or evil, Confucius’ teachings suggest an innate capacity for moral</p>
    <p>development. This is evident in his description of his own moral journey: “At fifteen, I set my</p>
    <p>mind upon learning…at seventy, I could follow my heart’s desires without overstepping the</p>
    <p>bounds of propriety.” (Analects, 2.4). This gradual unfolding of moral potential aligns more</p>
    <p>closely with Mengzi’s concept of the ‘seeds’ of virtue, yet also shares common ground with</p>
    <p>Xunzi’s emphasis on cultivation. All three philosophers stress the importance of education,</p>
    <p>ritual, and self-improvement in nurturing moral character. Confucius’ statement, “By nature</p>
    <p>people are similar; they diverge as the result of practice.” (Analects, 17.2), bridges the gap</p>
    <p>between Mengzi’s agricultural metaphors of nurturing innate goodness and Xunzi’s view of</p>
    <p>transforming human nature through conscious effort. While Mengzi focuses on justifying innate</p>
    <p>goodness and Xunzi on overcoming innate evil, Confucius emphasizes the practical aspects of</p>
    <p>moral behavior and social harmony. Ultimately, all three converge on the crucial role of creating</p>
    <p>an appropriate environment and the need for consistent self-reflection in actualizing moral</p>
    <p>potential, suggesting that goodness, whether innate, developed, or achieved through</p>
    <p>transformation, requires careful nurturing throughout one’s life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, Mengzi’s idealistic view that human nature is inherently good faces challenges,</p>
    <p>especially during times of scarcity. Mengzi himself acknowledges this: “In years of plenty, most</p>
    <p>young men are gentle; in years of poverty, most young men are cruel.” (Mengzi, Book 6A: 7.2)</p>
    <p>He argues that this is not due to a change in innate character but to environmental factors: “It is</p>
    <p>not that the potential that Heaven confers on them varies like this. They are like this because of</p>
    <p>that by which their hearts are sunk and drowned.” (Mengzi, Book 6A: 7.2) Yet, the effectiveness</p>
    <p>of environmental nurturing seems limited in less favorable times.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To argue in favor of Mengzi, we must recognize that his philosophical stance is most tenable in</p>
    <p>environments where proper nurturing is possible. However, when such nurturing environments</p>
    <p>are absent, the practical application of Mengzi's philosophy becomes more challenging. For</p>
    <p>instance, consider a situation where two parents must choose between saving their own child or</p>
    <p>another’s, with an equal chance of success in rescuing either. Most parents would naturally</p>
    <p>choose their own child, driven by a deep-seated instinct to protect their genetic legacy. This</p>
    <p>instinctual preference highlights a form of selfishness, an innate aspect of human nature that can</p>
    <p>overshadow the altruistic ideals Mengzi asserts.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Ignoring these survival instincts is akin to disregarding needs like sun and water. In this context,</p>
    <p>Xunzi’s perspective seems more realistic, as it addresses the less ideal aspects of human nature</p>
    <p>and acknowledges that prosperous environments, which might enable innate goodness to</p>
    <p>flourish, are rare in broader human history. Xunzi’s view on the need for conscious effort and</p>
    <p>societal structures in moral development, offers a more comprehensive understanding of humans</p>
    <p>as it correctly observes that one cannot stretch beyond the bounds of biology. Although it is</p>
    <p>expressed that he views the human nature as ‘bad’, it may be more correct to iterate his view as</p>
    <p>seeing humans as animalistic as we are, and avoiding to be arrogant with respect to the foods we</p>
    <p>consume and the planet we inhabit.</p>
