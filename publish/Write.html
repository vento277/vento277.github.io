		<h1>
			The Need to Write
		</h1>
		<p dir="ltr">
			April 2024
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			The act of reading is often encouraged from an early age; however, many find
			it agonizing regardless. I enjoyed reading from time to time, but it was
			only when I first set foot in Canada, at the age of 17 (2017), that I
			started reading more regularly.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			I had trouble learning the English language. My experience learning Mandarin
			back in China was tedious and painful. Though, I didn’t want the language to
			become an excuse for not seizing the opportunity my family had set before
			me.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			I started with books for primary students. I still remember the eye of a
			girl from the library who looked at me when I first walked into her aisle.
			It was a mixture of wonder and confusion (she probably thought I was a
			reading buddy), though we somehow became friends a few days later. She
			talked to me about random things in life, just like a typical 12-year-old,
			and I practiced my listening and speaking skills. She is perhaps one of the
			best English teachers I will ever meet.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Fast-forward to college, I became a lot more comfortable with the language.
			However, the nature of my degree, engineering, didn’t require me to be
			proficient in it. I continued reading books, mostly on topics that
			interested me at that time: Physics, Philosophy, and Love. Then, I came upon
			Paul Graham’s collection of essays.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			I hadn’t thought of reading essays at all before encountering him. For me,
			essays were assignments that had to be done for school, not something to be
			read leisurely. Paul Graham’s essays changed that. They were compact, filled
			with thoughts and ideas. It made it seem like most books were wasting words,
			therefore, time.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Naturally, as I read more essays, I had urges to write one myself. Thoughts
			would appear in my mind, seemingly perfect in their chain of reasoning. It
			was only when I had put the ink down that I realized how little the
			reasoning made sense. What equally startled me is how little ability I had
			in coming up with an original thought - something that is compiled from the
			question to answer all by myself.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			My mind was untrained and the thoughts were like an overnight dream, clouded
			by the spontaneity of the mind. Ideas were incomplete and hazy. In writing
			only, I discovered what it is like to truly give shape to otherwise random
			one-liners soon to be forgotten. The shape allowed me to stress-test and
			examine the chain of thought thoroughly; therefore, it became closer to
			completeness. Of course, completeness does not mean it is correct, but at
			least, the causal effect exists such that an idea is not with random
			dispersion.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			The need to read is prevalent among both parents and children; however, the
			need to write is less common. I’d assume this is because not all parents
			write. But as I go through my early 20s, the importance of writing seems
			more crucial than ever. Emails, project proposals, and letters to your lover
			all benefit from well-composed writing.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Writing, to me, is the most primitive way of encompassing the expression of
			one’s mind. It is also the best tool to train a mind to think critically of
			a matter that is not entirely numerical. To solve circuits, one comes up
			with a system of equations. To explore thoughts and ideas, one simply
			writes.
