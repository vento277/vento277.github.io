		<h1>
			The Need to Write

			April 2024

			Most people are encouraged to read as kids, but it almost never sticks.
			Before coming to Canada, I rarely read either. When I did, I was engrossed
			in Korean poetry, captivated by its expression of emotions and sceneries.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			When I landed in Vancouver at the age of 16, I found myself placed in the
			lowest ESL (English as a Second Language) class at my high school. This
			meant I would most likely struggle through my secondary education. But it
			wasn’t the forthcoming struggles that bothered me. Being at the bottom of
			the barrel troubled me more than anything else.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			To familiarize myself with English, I started reading books for kindergarten
			students. I still remember the look of a girl in the library when I walked
			up to her aisle. It was a mix of wonder and confusion. She probably mistook
			me for a reading buddy, while I felt terribly embarrassed to be there.
			Funnily enough, we quickly became friends. She talked about the things she
			liked, which of her peers annoyed her, and why she hated math so much, while
			I practiced my listening and speaking skills. She remains one of the best
			English teachers I've ever had.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Fast-forward to my freshman year of college, I grew somewhat detached from
			studying English. My degree in engineering didn’t demand extreme proficiency
			in it. Nonetheless, I continued to read books, mainly on love and
			investments. Then, I stumbled upon the works of Paul Graham.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Before encountering his work, I hadn’t thought of reading essays. For me,
			essays were assignments that had to be done for school, not something to be
			read leisurely. He changed that. They were compact, filled with ideas and
			reasoning. It made me think that most books were wasting words and,
			therefore, time.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			As I read more essays, I grew interested in writing my own. Ideas would
			appear in my head, seemingly perfect in their chain of reasoning, only to be
			found flawed when written down. What also seemed easy at first was the
			process of choosing a topic. It turns out most, if not all, of my ideas were
			either from my parents, school, or entertainment I chose to consume. I
			rarely pursued a thought in its pure form, tapping the branches of possible
			answers. Doing this for the first time felt like playing a game of chess,
			but without any rows or columns.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			In other words, my mind was untrained. Thoughts were like an overnight
			dream, clouded by the spontaneity of the mind. Only in writing them down did
			I discover what it is like to truly give shape to otherwise random
			one-liners soon to be forgotten. Writing allowed me to stress-test and
			examine the chain of thought, getting closer to completeness. Of course,
			completeness does not mean it is correct, but at least the causal effect
			exists so that an idea is not randomly dispersed.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			The need to read is prevalent among parents and kids. The need to write, on
			the other hand, is not as enforced. This is likely because most adults don’t
			write, at least not their thoughts or opinions. When is the last time you’ve
			seen a political opinion written down in detail by someone close to you? And
			yet, when the topic comes up, most have a say about it. We trust the
			spontaneity of the mind too much. I would argue that most people's so-called
			opinions are just that.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			As I go through my early 20s, the importance of writing seems more crucial
			than ever. It is arguably the most fundamental way of expressing one’s mind,
			and it is also the best tool to train a mind to think critically about
			matters that are not entirely numerical.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<p dir="ltr">
			Most minds are capable of critical thinking, but all have their flaws. I aim
			to use writing as a tool to bypass spontaneous opinions and thoughts on
			topics I truly care about. Not writing about the topics I care about means I
			would never have a chance to form complete opinions on them. Therefore, I
			have a need to write, at least, about topics that I think are important.
