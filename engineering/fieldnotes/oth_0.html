        There are two types of notes. Technical and Non-technical. Non-technicals are anything that does not involove applied mathematics. 
        
        There are three steps in note taking. Collecting, refining and publishing. 
        Collecting is done with a pen and paper. These are usually quick notes and scribbles that are not orgnaized.
        Refining is the process of putting the information in a cohesive order such that it facilitates the understanding of a topic. This is done using tools such as Google docs or Overleaf
        Finally, publishing is the process of making the note final such that it can be re-vistsed for review. This is done through my personal website, typically in html or pdf.

        html will be used for techinical topics as it is more suitable for a blog-type writing. Whereas all non-techinical topics such as investment thesis is relsead in pdf.
        For codes, github is used.
