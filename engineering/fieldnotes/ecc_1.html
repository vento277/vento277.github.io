    <section>
        A finite field (or Galois field) is a field with a finite number of elements. 
        A field is more than just a set; it is a structure consisting of a set of elements along with two operations—addition and multiplication—satisfying specific algebraic properties. 
        The corresponding inverse operations are subtraction and division.
        <br><br>

        <h1>Sets</h1>
        A set is an arbitrary collection of objects or elements. When an element \( X \) is in a set \( S \), we write \( X \in S \). If element \( X \) is not in set \( S \), we write \( X \notin S \). Furthermore, \( Y \) is considered a subset of \( X \) if and only if all elements of \( Y \) are also elements of \( X \), which is denoted as \( Y \subset X \).
        <br><br>

        <h1>Groups</h1>
        A group, \( G \), is a set with an operation that satisfies four key properties:<br>
        - Closure: The result of the operation on any two elements of the group is still in the group, \(a * b \in G\)<br>
        - Associativity: The grouping of the elements does not affect the result. For any \( a, b, c \) in the group, \( (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) \).<br>
        - Identity element: There is an identity element such that for any element \( a \), \( a * e = e * a = a \), where \( e \) is the identity.<br>
        - Inverse: For every element \( a \), there exists an element \( a^{-1} \) such that \( a *  a^{-1} =  a^{-1} * a = e \).
        <br><br>

        Now, let's look at a few generic examples:<br>
        - (Z, +): The set \( \mathbb{Z} \) represents all integers, and the operation is addition.<br>
        -- The identity is 0 because adding 0 to any integer \( i \) gives you \( i \), i.e., \( i + 0 = 0 + i = i \).<br>
        -- The inverse of an integer \( i \) is \( -i \) because \( i + (-i) = 0 \), which is the identity element.
        <br><br>
        - (Q - {0}, ·): This is the set of nonzero rational numbers \( \mathbb{Q} \), and the operation is multiplication.<br>
        -- The identity is 1 because multiplying any rational number \( \frac{p}{q} \) by 1 gives back \( \frac{p}{q} \).<br>
        -- The inverse of a rational number \( \frac{p}{q} \) is \( \frac{q}{p} \), because \( \frac{p}{q} \times \frac{q}{p} = 1 \), which is the identity element.
        <br><br>
        - ({0, 1}, \( \oplus \)): This is a small set, where the operation is exclusive-OR (\( \oplus \)).<br>
        -- The identity is 0 because for any \( i \in \{0, 1\} \), \( i \oplus 0 = 0 \oplus i = i \)<br>
        -- The inverse is itself, meaning \( i \oplus i = 0 \), so both 0 and 1 are their own inverses.
        <br><br>

        More specific examples of modular groups:<br>
        - (S = {0, 1, 2, ..., m-1}, \(\boxplus\)): This is a set of natural numbers (m is also a natural number), where the operation is modular addition.<br>
        -- The identity is 0, because for any \( i \in S \), \( i \boxplus 0 = 0 \boxplus i = i \).<br>
        -- The inverse of \( i \) is \( m - i \), because \( i \oplus (m - i) = 0 \).<br>
        -- The group is commutative, meaning \( i \boxplus j = j \boxplus i \). This is because regular addition is commutative, and modular arithmetic preserves this property.
        <br><br>
        - (S = {1, 2, ..., p-1}, \(\boxdot\)): This is a set of natural numbers (p is a prime number), where the opeartion is modular multiplication.<br>
        -- The identity element is 1, because multiplying any number \( i \) by 1 results in \( i \).<br>
        -- To find the inverse of an element \( i \), we need to find a number \( b \) such that \( i \boxdot b = 1 \mod p \). This is equivalent to solving for \( b \) in the equation:<br>
        \[
        i \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod p
        \]
        This can be solved using Euclid’s Theorem, which guarantees that if \( i \) and \( p \) are relatively prime (i.e., \( \gcd(i, p) = 1 \)), there exist integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that:<br>
        \[
        a \cdot i + b \cdot p = 1
        \]
        Meaning that \( a \boxdot i = 1 \mod p \), so \( a \) is the inverse of \( i \) under multiplication modulo \( p \).         
        <br><br> 

        <h2>Subgroups</h2>
        A subset \( H \) os a group \( G \) is called a subset if it satisfies:<br>
        - Closure: For all \( h_1, h_2 \in H \), the result of the operation \( h_1 \ast h_2 \) is also in \( H \).<br>
        - Identity: The identity element \( e \) of \( G \) is in \( H \).<br>
        - Inverses: For every \( h \in H \), the inverse \( h^{-1} \) is also in \( H \).
        <br><br>

        <h2>Cosets</h2>
        A coset is a specific type of subset formed from a subgroup. It represents the set of elements you get by combining each element of subgroup
        with a fixed element from the entire group. There are two types:<br>
        - Left Coset of \( H \) with element \( a \in G \): The set \( a \ast H = \{ a \ast h : h \in H \} \).<br>
        - Right Coset of \( H \) with element \( a \in G \): The set \( H \ast a = \{ h \ast a : h \in H \} \).
        <br><br>

        As an example, let  \( G = \{0, 1, 2, \dots, 15\} \) be a group under modulo 16 addition, and let \( H = \{0, 4, 8, 12\} \) be a subgroup of \( G \), the :<br>
        \[
        3 \boxplus H = \{3 \boxplus 0, 3 \boxplus 4, 3 \boxplus 8, 3 \boxplus 12\} = \{3, 7, 11, 15\} 
        \]

        These are the left coset of 3 in \( G \) with respect to \( H \).
        <br><br>

        <i>Theorem 1 - No Two Identical Elements in a Coset</i><br>
        If \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) with \( \ast \), then no two elements in a coset of \( H \) are identical. This can be proven by
        supposing that two elements \( a \ast h \) and \( a \ast h' \) from the coset \( a \ast H \) are identical, where \( h \) and \( h' \) are distinct elements of \( H \).
        Let \( a^{-1} \) be the inverse of \( a \). Then:
        \[
        a^{-1} \ast (a \ast h) = a^{-1} \ast (a \ast h')
        \]
        Simplifying:
        \[
        e \ast h = e \ast h' \quad \text{(where \( e \) is the identity)}
        \]
        This gives:
        \[
        h = h'
        \]

        Hence, \( a \ast h = a \ast h' \) implies \( h = h' \), proving that no two distinct elements in a coset are the same. 
        <br><br>

        <i>Theorem 2 - No Two Identical Elements in Two Different Cosets</i><br>
        If two cosets ahre an element, then they must be identical. This can be proven by taking 
        any two cosets of \( H \), say \( a \ast H \) and \( b \ast H \), and suppose an element \( x \) appears in both cosets, 
        \( x \in a \ast H \) and \( x \in b \ast H \), then:<br>
        \[
        a^{-1} \in x \ast H,&emsp;b^{-1} \in x \ast H
        \]

        This implies \( a^{-1} \ast b \in H \), meaning \(a \ast H = b \ast H\)
        <br><br>

        From the theorems above, we deduce:<br>
        - Each element of \( G \) appears in exactly one coset.<br>
        - Cosets are either identical or disjoint.<br>
        - The union of all cosets forms the enture group \( G \).<br>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Fields</h1>
        A field is a set \( F \) equipped with two binary operations: addition (\(+\)) and multiplication (\(\cdot\)). 
        The set \( F \) along with these operations forms a field if the following conditions hold:<br>
        - \((F, +)\) forms a commutative group with an identity element called the additive identity (denoted as \( 0 \)).<br>
        - \((F - 0, \cdot)\) forms a commutative group with an identity element called the multiplicative identity (denoted as \( 1 \)).<br>
        - Multiplication is distributive over addition, meaning for any \( a, b, c \in F \): \( a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \)
        <br><br>
       
        Note that:<br>
        - The order of a field is the number of elements in the field.<br>
        - A finite fieldis a field with a finite order.<br>
        - Subtraction in a field is defined as: \[ a - b = a + (-b) \] where \(-b\) is the additive inverse of \( b \).<br>
        - Division in a field is defined as: \[ \frac{a}{b} = a \cdot b^{-1} \] where \( b^{-1} \) is the multiplicative inverse of \( b \).
        <br><br>

        Field properties include:<br>
        - For all \( a \in F \), \( a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0 \).<br>
        - For all \( a, b \in F \), if both are nonzero, then \( a \cdot b \neq 0 \).<br>
        - If \( a \cdot b = 0 \) and \( a \neq 0 \), then \( b = 0 \).<br>
        - For all \( a, b \in F \): \( -(a \cdot b) = (-a) \cdot b = a \cdot (-b) \)<br>
        - Cancellation Law: If \( a \neq 0 \) and \( a \cdot b = a \cdot c \), then \( b = c \).
        <br><br>

        Now, let's look at 2 examples: <br>
        - \((\mathbb{R}, +, \cdot)\) is an infinite field as it contains all real numbers.<br>
        - \((\{0, 1\}, \boxplus, \boxtimes)\) is a finite field also known as a Galois Field, denoted as \( GF(2) \).<br>
        -- A Galois Field with \( p \) elements is denoted as \( GF(p) \).
        Every field must contain at least two elements: the additive identity \( 0 \) and the multiplicative identity \( 1 \). Thus, \( p \geq 2 \).<br>
        -- For GF(3), the next smallest field after \( GF(2) \) is \( GF(3) \), which consists of the set \( \{0,1,2\} \) with addition and multiplication modulo 3<br>
        -- For a prime \( p \), the set of integers \( \{0, 1, \dots, p - 1\} \) forms a field under modulo \( p \) addition and multiplication.
        This field is called a prime field, denoted as \( GF(p) \). Modulo arithmetic cannot construct a field if \( p \) is not prime.<br>
        -- Finite fields \( GF(q) \) do not exist for all values of \( q \). 
        However, the prime field \( GF(p) \) can be extended to a field of \( p^m \) elements, denoted as \( GF(p^m) \), where \( m \geq 2 \).
        This is known as an extended prime field. The finite fields \( GF(p^m) \) can be constructed as vector spaces over the prime field \( GF(p) \).
        <br><br>

        <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h1>Vector</h1>
        A vector space consists of:<br>
        - A set \( V \) of elements called vectors, with a defined binary operation addition \( + \).<br>
        - A field \( F \) of elements called scalars.<br>
        - A multiplication operation \( \cdot \) between elements of \( F \) and elements of \( V \).
        <br><br>
        
        \( V \) is a vector space over \( F \) if it satisfies:<br>
        - Commutative Group: \( (V, +) \) forms a commutative group:
        \[
        v \in V, \quad u + v = v + u \in V
        \]
        - Closure under Scalar Multiplication:
        \[
        v \in V, \quad a \in F, \quad a \cdot v \in V
        \]
        - Distributive Laws: 
        \[
        a \cdot (u + v) = a \cdot u + a \cdot v, \quad (a + b) \cdot u = a \cdot u + b \cdot u
        \]
        - Associativity: 
        \[
        v \in V, \quad a, b \in F, \quad (a \cdot b) v = a \cdot (b \cdot v)
        \]
        - Multiplicative Identity: Let 1 be the unit element in \( F \), then:
        \[
        v \in V, \quad 1 \cdot v = v
        \]
        <br>
        
        Fields operations include:<br>
        - Vector Addition: Addition within \( V \).<br>
        - Scalar Multiplication: Multiplication of a vector in \( V \) by a scalar in \( F \).<br>
        - Zero Vector \( 0 \): The additive identity in \( V \).<br>
        - Zero Scalar \( 0 \): The zero element in \( F \).
        <br><br>

        Field properties include:<br>
        - \( 0 \cdot v = 0 \) for all \( v \in V \).<br>
        - \( c \cdot 0 = 0 \) for all \( c \in F \).<br>
        - \( (-c) \cdot v = c \cdot (-v) = -(c \cdot v) \).
        <br><br>
        
        What about finite fields? Consider an ordered sequence of \( n \) components (\( n \)-tuple), \((v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1})\),      
        where \( v_i \in GF(p) \) (a finite field of order \( p \)):<br>
        - Addition (modulo-\( p \)):
        \[
        v \in V, \quad u + v = (u_0 + v_0, u_1 + v_1, \dots, u_{n-1} + v_{n-1})
        \]
        - Scalar Multiplication (modulo-\( p \)): 
        \[
        v \in V, \quad a \in GF(p), \quad a \cdot v = (a \cdot v_0, a \cdot v_1, \dots, a \cdot v_{n-1})
        \]
        This vector space over \( GF(p) \) is denoted \( V_n \).
        <br><br>

        Now let's dive in to an example. Consider a vector space \( V_3 \) over \( GF(2) \) consists of the following \( 2^3 = 8 \) elements:  
        \[
        (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1)
        \]
        
        Example operations:
        \[
        (0,1,1) + (1,1,0) = (1,0,1)
        \]
        \[
        0 \cdot (0,1,1) = (0,0,0)
        \]
        \[
        1 \cdot (0,1,1) = (0,1,1)
        \]
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Subspaces</h2>       
        A subspace \( S \) of \( V \) over \( F \) is a subset of \( V \) that is also a vector space over \( F \). 
        A nonempty subset \( S \) of \( V \) is a subspace if:<br>
        - Closure under Addition: \( \forall u, v \in S \), then \( u + v \in S \).<br>
        - Closure under Scalar Multiplication: \( \forall a \in F, \forall u \in S \), then \( a \cdot u \in S \).<br>
        <br>
        Since a subspace is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication, it is also a subgroup of \( V \).
        <br><br>

        As an example, for \( V_3 \) over \( GF(2) \), \( \{(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1)\} \) is a subspace of \( V_3 \) over \( GF(2) \).
        <br><br>

        <h2>Linear Combinations</h2>       
        Given vectors \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \in V \) and scalars \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \in F \), the expression:<br>
        \[
        a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \dots + a_k v_k
        \]
        is called a linear combination of \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \).
        The set of all linear combinations of \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \) forms a subspace of \( V \).

        <br><br>
        As an example, consider vectors \( (0,1,0) \) and \( (0,1,1) \), their linear combinations are:<br>
        \[
        0 \cdot (0,1,0) + 0 \cdot (0,1,1) = (0,0,0)
        \]
        \[
        0 \cdot (0,1,0) + 1 \cdot (0,1,1) = (0,1,1)
        \]
        \[
        1 \cdot (0,1,0) + 0 \cdot (0,1,1) = (0,1,0)
        \]
        \[
        1 \cdot (0,1,0) + 1 \cdot (0,1,1) = (0,0,1)
        \]
        This forms the same subspace as in the previous example.
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Linear Dependence</h2>
        A set of vectors \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \) is linearly dependent if there exist scalars \( a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k \in F \), not all zero, such that:
        \[
        a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \dots + a_k v_k = 0
        \]
        Otherwise, the vectors are linearly independent. In general, vectors are linearly dependent if one can be written as the
        linear combination of the others. For instance, for subspaces example, the vectors are linearly dependent as:
        \[
        (0,0,1) + (0,1,0) = (0,1,1)
        \]
        <br><br>

        <h2>Spanning Sets and Bases</h2>
        A set of vectors \( \{ v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k \} \) spans a vector space \( V \) if every vector in \( V \) can be expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:
        \[
        v = a_1 v_1 + a_2 v_2 + \dots + a_k v_k, \quad v \in V, \quad a_i \in F.
        \]
        <br>

        A basis of \( V \) is a linearly independent spanning set. This means that:
        <br>
        - The vectors in the basis are linearly independent.<br>
        - Any vector in \( V \) can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of these basis vectors.
        <br><br>
        The number of vectors in a basis is called the dimension of \( V \), denoted as \( \dim(V) \). If \( \dim(V) = k \), then any set of more than \( k \) vectors in \( V \) must be linearly dependent.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Inner Product and Orthogonality</h2>
        The inner product of two vectors \( u, v \in V \) is defined as:
        \[
        u \cdot v = u_0 v_0 + u_1 v_1 + \dots + u_{n-1} v_{n-1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} u_i v_i
        \]
        <br>
        Two vectors \( u \) and \( v \) are said to be orthogonal if \( u \cdot v = 0 \).
        
        <br><br>
        Inner product properties:
        <br>
        - Commutativity: \( u \cdot v = v \cdot u \)<br>
        - Distributivity: \( u \cdot (v + w) = u \cdot v + u \cdot w \)<br>
        - Scalar Associativity: \( (a u) \cdot v = a (u \cdot v) \)
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Null Space</h2>
        In the context of coding theory, the null space is often important for finding error-detecting or correcting codes because it relates to the way information is transmitted and how errors can be identified and corrected during transmission.
        Given a \( k \)-dimensional subspace \( S \) of \( V_n \), the null space (or dual space) \( S_d \) consists of all vectors \( v \) such that:
        \[
        u \cdot v = 0, \quad \forall u \in S
        \]
        <br>
        The null space \( S_d \) is itself a subspace of \( V_n \) with dimension \( \dim(S_d) = n - k \), satisfying:
        \[
        \dim(S) + \dim(S_d) = n
        \]
        <br>
        
        <h2>Matrices and Row Space</h2>
        A \( k \times n \) matrix \( G \) over \( GF(2) \) is a rectangular array:
        \[
        G = \begin{bmatrix} g_0 \\ g_1 \\ \vdots \\ g_{k-1} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} g_{00} & g_{01} & \dots & g_{0,n-1} \\ g_{10} & g_{11} & \dots & g_{1,n-1} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ g_{k-1,0} & g_{k-1,1} & \dots & g_{k-1,n-1} \end{bmatrix}
        \]
        <br>
        If the \( k \) rows of \( G \) are linearly independent, they form a \( k \)-dimensional subspace of \( V_n \), called the row space of \( G \).
        <br><br>
        Elementary row operations on \( G \):<br>
        - Swapping two rows.<br>
        - Adding one row to another.<br>
        - Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar.<br>
        <br>
        These operations do not change the row space of \( G \).
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Parity Check Matrices</h2>
        Let \( S \) be the row space of a \( k \times n \) matrix \( G \) with \( \dim(S) = k \). The null space \( S_d \) is defined by \( n-k \) linearly independent vectors forming the rows of an \( (n-k) \times n \) matrix \( H \):
        \[
        H = \begin{bmatrix} h_0 \\ h_1 \\ \vdots \\ h_{n-k-1} \end{bmatrix}
        \]
        <br>
        For any \( k \times n \) matrix \( G \) over \( GF(2) \), there exists an \( (n-k) \times n \) matrix \( H \) such that:
        \[
        g_i \cdot h_j = 0, \quad \forall g_i \in G, \quad \forall h_j \in H.
        \]
        That is, the row space of \( G \) is the null space of \( H \), and vice versa.
        
        <br><br>
        
        <h2>Matrix Operations</h2>
        - Matrix Addition: Given two \( k \times n \) matrices \( A \) and \( B \), their sum is computed element-wise:
        \[
        C = A + B = \begin{bmatrix} a_{ij} + b_{ij} \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        - Matrix Multiplication: Given a \( k \times n \) matrix \( A \) and an \( n \times \ell \) matrix \( B \), their product is defined as:
        \[
        C = A \times B = \begin{bmatrix} c_{ij} \end{bmatrix}, \quad c_{ij} = \sum_{t=0}^{n-1} a_{it} b_{tj}.
        \]
        
        <br>
        Example:
        \[
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix},
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        Here, the row space of the first matrix is the null space of the second, verifying \( g_i \cdot h_j = 0 \) for all rows.

        Why are we using modulo arithmetic? Imagine you have a circle, and on that circle, you have numbers going around it. 
        Let's say you have a small circle with the numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3. When you get to 3, instead of continuing to 4, you go back to 0. 
        It's like wrapping around the circle!
        <br><br>

        This "wrapping around" is what modulo arithmetic does. It helps us work with numbers in a special way: instead of letting them grow forever, 
        it keeps them within a set range. So, for example, if you're doing math with a circle that has 4 numbers (0, 1, 2, 3), 
        if you add 3 + 2, you'd normally get 5, but because of the "wrap around" rule (mod 4), you end up with 1 (since 5 wraps around to 1).
        <br><br>

        Now, why do we use this for sets and groups? Well, imagine you want to group things together that have a pattern. 
        Modulo arithmetic helps you find those patterns. Like when you have a set of numbers, say {0, 1, 2, 3}, and you're trying to find out how things repeat or 
        what happens when you keep adding numbers together. Modulo lets you see the repeating parts and makes calculations easier because you only need to 
        think about the numbers within the set, not big, crazy ones.
        <br><br>

        In cryptography and computer science, numbers can get HUGE, and doing math with such big numbers can be hard. But using modulo arithmetic, 
        we can "shrink" numbers to a manageable size.
